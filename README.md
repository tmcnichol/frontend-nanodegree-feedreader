# Overview - Feed Reader Testing

This is a series of [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) tests for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The starter code was provided by Udacity.com as part of the frontend-nanoedegree project#4. The changes that I've made were on the feedreader.js file.

## What does it test for?

These tests are designed to ensure basic functionality and operation of this application. For greater detail on purpose and functionality of each test, please refer to the comments on each section found in the feedreader.js file.

## Run Instructions

To run the tests, simply clone this repository to your local directory, and open the index.html file in your browser. The repository already includes the necessary Jasmine 2.1.2 files to run the tests. Once the index.hmtal file is opened, the tests will run automatically and display 7 specs, 0 failures (all tests passing).

## Contributing

This repository is in the process of being reviewed for completion credit as part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests until I have received instructor feedback and completed this project
